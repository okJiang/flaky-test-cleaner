You are currently developing a large and complex task.
- WORK.md describes the task requirements in Feature Request section, you must read it carefully before working-
- A large task must be break down into smaller sub-tasks （and make adjustments according to your latest knowledge）.
- For each sub-task, you need to write detailed work plan in WORK.md under Agent Work Plan section.
- If some sub-task is complex after dig deeper, you can further break it down into smaller tasks in the work plan. You also need to track your development progress in WORK.md under Agent Work Plan section, so that you can effectively manage your development without losing sight of the overall goals. During you explore the code base, you must organize what you have learned in .codex/knowledge' directory using .md files：
- You must keep facts, details and code locations in there, instead of summarizing or giving high-level overviews.
- Before starting working. you must also try to read from existing knowledge. If you find all task items in your work plan are completed in WORK.md, then you should start a new task：
- Carefully read the current changes （in git diff and in staging area） you have made so far, compare them with your work plan, and verify that all critical components in the design document have been implemented, and think what else can be improved in engineerings aspects （code quality, performance, readability, modularity, test coverage, etc）. We seek for production-quality code, high performance and correctness. Your new discoveries and improvements should also be recorded in WORK.md under Agent Work Plan section. Finally, never ask me any questions. You decide everything by yourself. You can always explore the code base and read from existing knowledge to resolve your doubts.
- Once you complete a sub-task, you need to commit and push them to github.
